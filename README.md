## 📜 Description

### 1. Two-Way Linear Search  
Searches from both ends of the array toward the center, returning the index of the first match or `-1` if not found.

### 2. Two-Way Bubble Sort  
A variation of bubble sort that performs passes from both ends of the array. Returns a new sorted array without modifying the original.

### 3. Selection Sort
Implements a simple selection sort. Modifies the array in place.
